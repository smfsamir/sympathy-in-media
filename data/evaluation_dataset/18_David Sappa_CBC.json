  "He started heading toward them, and police fired at him.",
  "He was taken to hospital, where he died. The man has not been identified.",
  "Seven members of the BEI have been dispatched to the village to investigate. A forensic identification technician from the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec will assist.",
