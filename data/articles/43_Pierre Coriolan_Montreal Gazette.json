  "Man killed by police was facing eviction and distressed, neighbours say",
  "A distressed man shot dead by Montreal police in his subsidized housing unit Tuesday night was facing eviction from his apartment on July 1 and appeared to have mental health problems, his neighbours said.",
  "The Quebec rental board issued an eviction order against Pierre Coriolan on June 1 because he had been disturbing the peace in the complex and tried to start a fire in his studio apartment, said Claudine Laurin, director general of la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des OSBL d\u2019habitation de Montr\u00e9al, an organization of subsidized housing apartments.",
  "Coriolan had lived in the apartment in the Gay Village since 2008, but began having behavioural issues last fall, Laurin said. \u201cHe was unstable and it became a problem for the neighbours,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t well.\u201d",
  "The rental board decision says Coriolan was constantly yelling and screaming and on one occasion last September, firefighters discovered thick smoke in his kitchen after he had left a pot of boiling water on his stove. On another occasion, a neighbour testified that he saw Coriolan sneak out of his apartment after the fire alarm sounded.",
  "On Tuesday night, neighbours called the police after Coriolan began destroying his apartment and breaking windows, Laurin said.",
  "When police arrived, they found him wielding a screwdriver in each hand, according to the Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes \u2014 the Quebec\u2019s police watchdog group that is investigating the fatal shooting.",
  "Police tried and failed to subdue him using a Taser and plastic bullets, the BEI said. It\u2019s unclear what then prompted them to fire multiple shots with their service revolvers.",
  "Laurin said her staff tried to get Coriolan help last fall, but she said he refused their offer. \u201cWe tried to work with him and get him help but if a person doesn\u2019t want help, we can\u2019t force him to take it,\u201d she said, adding that she doesn\u2019t think he was being followed by social services.",
  "Coriolan is of Haitian origin and lived alone in his third-floor studio apartment on Robillard Ave.",
  "Neighbours also complained that Coriolan frequently opened and closed his apartment door at all hours. At a rental board hearing in May, Coriolan testified that he had a medical condition that forced him to leave his apartment many times during the night, even as late as 3 a.m.",
  "Lawrence Dulac said he heard his neighbour screaming in the corridor shortly after police arrived Tuesday evening.",
  "Officers told the man several times to calm down and to get on the ground, he said. Dulac said he shut his door and then heard police fire five or six shots. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is someone we have known for several years even if we didn\u2019t talk to him.\u201d",
  "When Urgence-Sant\u00e9 arrived on the scene at around 7:30 p.m., Coriolan was in cardiac arrest. Paramedics attempted to perform CPR. Coriolan was taken to a hospital and died around 9:45 p.m.",
  "Dulac said he often heard his neighbour screaming in his apartment and on the balcony.",
  "\u201cWhen people are sick, they sometimes scream,\u201d Dulac said. \u201cHe may have bothered other people but he didn\u2019t bother me. I didn\u2019t say anything to him when he screamed because I knew the man was ill. He screamed everyday.\u201d",
  "Dulac said he did not recall the police ever having been called to the apartment before to deal with Coriolan.",
  "Sylvie Dauzois, who lives one floor below Coriolan\u2019s apartment, described him as stressed, anxious and introverted, and said he was difficult to converse with. \u201cHe was reserved and didn\u2019t talk about himself,\u201d she said.",
  "Dauzois said she heard commotion coming from his apartment Tuesday evening and was saddened to learn the next morning that he had died.",
  "\u201cI heard three shots, but my door was closed so I didn\u2019t hear anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you think; you don\u2019t know who it can happen to.\u201d",
  "Another neighbour who lives on the same floor as Coriolan said he would break plates in his kitchen when he was in distress. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t doing very well,\u201d said the neighbour, who gave his name only as Guy.",
  "He said he heard three loud bangs from the apartment after police arrived Tuesday.",
  "A resident who lives in a condo beside the subsidized housing block said \u201cthe cops are called there a lot because there is always something going on.\u201d",
  "Two years ago, a 54-year-old man died after being stabbed in a basement unit in the same apartment building. The 36-unit apartment is governed by Montreal\u2019s subsidized housing organization.",
  "The resident said he didn\u2019t hear any commotion coming from the building on Tuesday evening. \u201cI have kids and I am trying to sell my condo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get out.\u201d"
