  "Quebec crown prosecutors say the evidence produced by the province\u2019s police watchdog \u2013 the Bureau des enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes \u2013 did not indicate a criminal offence was committed.",
  "Police say they were called to the scene to break up a fight at the corner of Montclair Avenue and Boulevard de Maisonneuve.",
  "During that intervention, one of the two men involved allegedly approached an officer with a knife.",
  "Officers say they then used a stun gun on the man \u201cwithout success,\u201d and then fatally shot him. The man was later identified as Gibbs.",
  "The Gibbs family filed a $1-million lawsuit against the City of Montreal in October 2018, arguing police used excessive and disproportionate force against him.",
  "That lawsuit has been waiting to go ahead and it\u2019s unclear what will happen with it now. Gibbs was a father of three.",
