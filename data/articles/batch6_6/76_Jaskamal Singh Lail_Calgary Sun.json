  "Some of the hundreds who attended a service for 25-year-old Jaskamal (Jas) Singh Lail at northeast funeral home spoke out, calling for justice and saying the man would still be alive if police took different actions on Aug. 31.",
  "They said few people knew of the years Lail battled mental health issues, adding they saw him face a \u201ctorturous cycle through a complicated health care system.\u201d",
  "Family members said they hoped his death will bring awareness to mental health battles people face on a daily basis and further situations like the one leading up to Lail\u2019s death will be prevented.",
  "Lail was shot and killed by Calgary police hours after he was involved in an altercation at a northeast gym more than a week ago.",

  "The incident began the night of Aug. 30, when police were called to a northeast gym after reports of an altercation. Lail was seen circling the gym for hours before driving dangerously back to his Redstone home.",
  "Believing the man was suffering from a mental health crisis, officials said, officers left the man alone, with plans to return the next day, towing his vehicle around 2:20 a.m. Friday morning.",
  "Less than an hour and a half later, police returned to his residence for a noise complaint before they encountered him near the intersection of Redstone Drive and Redstone Street N.E.",
  "Police said an altercation occurred that led officers to first use a less-lethal ARWEN launcher \u2014 a weapon that shoots a plastic round \u2014 in an attempt to deter the man before opening fire with a service pistol.",
  "It was the first time the incapacitating weapon has been used by a frontline officer in Calgary, a key recommendation from a sweeping use of force report released earlier this year.",
  "The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team is investigating the shooting.",
  "Jay Sidhu, a longtime friend and gym partner of Lail\u2019s, said he finds it hard to believe the \u201cgood-natured kid\u201d would ever find himself caught in a deadly confrontation with police.",
  "\u201cHe just wanted to be left alone \u2014 he was always quiet and kept to himself,\u201d said Sidhu, who last spoke to his friend Lail just two days before his death.",
  "\u201cI was just shocked \u2014 he was such a quiet and innocent guy. He would never hurt anybody.\u201d",
  "Like family members at Lail\u2019s service on Saturday, Sidhu was also eager for answers and justice in the case, noting he\u2019s heard very little of the details of his friend\u2019s death.",
  "The day after Lail\u2019s death, police said the man appeared to be suffering from a \u201cmental health crisis.\u201d",
  "Sidhu confirmed Lail had struggled with schizophrenia, a chronic mental health disorder that can include symptoms including hallucination and delusion.",
  "\u201cHe always had headphones on and he would listen to hardcore music,\u201d Sidhu said, noting Lail had previously told him he would occasionally hear voices.",
  "But, Sidhu noted, his friend appeared to be coping with his disorder, making his violent death even more hard to fathom."
