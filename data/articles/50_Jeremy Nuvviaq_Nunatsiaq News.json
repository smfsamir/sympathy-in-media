  "No \u2018universally accepted\u2019 way to prevent \u2018suicide by cop,\u2019 say experts",
  "Inquest underway into fatal police shooting of Jeremy Nuvviaq at his Sanirajak home in 2017",
  "An inquest into the the 2017 death of Jeremy Nuvviaq, 39, continued Wednesday with testimonies from experts in police use of force and suicide prevention. Nuvviaq had been threatening \u201csuicide by cop\u201d in a Facebook livestream and later confronted police who came to his home with a pellet gun. (File photo)",
  "There is no \u201cuniversally accepted\u201d guide for resolving a \u201csuicide by police\u201d call, according to an expert in police use of force who testified on the third day of an inquest into the shooting death of Jeremy Nuvviaq.",
  "Nuvviaq, 39, was shot by one of two RCMP officers who responded to a call in 2017 in Sanirajak after he threatened \u201csuicide by cop\u201d on Facebook and confronted police with what looked like a gun.",
  "Sgt. Brad Fawcett of the Vancouver Police Department said it is challenging for officers to respond to possible suicide-by-cop attempts because of the \u201ccognitive load\u201d they feel when responding to stressful calls where there is a possible public safety risk.",
  "\u201cWe have lots of suggestions based on anecdotal evidence on different calls and how they were resolved, but there\u2019s no universally accepted step-by-step way to consult,\u201d he said.",
  "While the RCMP does provide training for its officers in dealing with people in crisis and de-escalation, \u201cthere is no magic pixie dust that is going to make an intoxicated person sober, that is going to make a mentally ill person\u2026 cooperate voluntarily with whatever the goal is.\u201d",
  "\u201cYou have to remember that when you\u2019re doing scenarios, you\u2019d have a role player that\u2019s following a script, and the real world doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
  "\u201cThe subject you\u2019re dealing with in the real world gets a vote \u2014 they can decide to follow the directions of the officers or not.\u201d",
  "An Ottawa Police Service investigation revealed that Nuvviaq actually had two different guns \u2014 a brightly-coloured toy handgun that he held under a towel in the Facebook livestream, and a black-and-yellow airsoft pellet gun he carried outside when the police arrived at his home.",
  "The RCMP officers who responded therefore saw Nuvviaq aiming at them with a rifle that did not match the description of the toy gun witnesses had seen in the Facebook video.",
  "Fawcett said police are trained to \u201ctreat all firearms if they\u2019re real until you prove they\u2019re not,\u201d he said.",
  "\u201cYou don\u2019t trust your life to somebody else\u2019s assessment, whether a firearm is real or a replica. I wouldn\u2019t even take the word of another police officer that it\u2019s a toy gun, unless I had significant trust in that officer.\u201d",
  "Another challenge in preventing suicide-by-cop scenarios is recognizing in the first place when a person is at risk of dying by suicide, said Victoria Madsen, assistant deputy minister of the GN\u2019s mental health and suicide prevention programs.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult because the type of suicide move movies talk about [is] about suicide notes, about people getting their affairs together before they take their own lives. But in actuality, in real life, a fair number of suicides occur in the moment.\u201d",
  "On Tuesday, the inquest jury heard testimony from community mental health worker Kirsty Williams that Nuvviaq seemed \u201cforward-thinking\u201d and did not appear to have any suicidal ideations when he met with her several times before his death.",
  "\u201cHe was doing well. His relationship was going well, he was avoiding alcohol and he really wanted to turn over a new leaf,\u201d Williams said, adding that Nuvviaq told her he had bought some self-help books and was enjoying his classes at Nunavut Arctic College.",
  "She testified that in March 2017, however, Nuvviaq asked her to write a letter to the housing committee to help his family secure better housing. At the time, there were nine people living in a two-bedroom home, Williams said.",
  "\u201cHousing needs are definitely one of the underlying causes of people who attempt to take their life,\u201d Madsen said. \u201cOften counsellors will go to their supervisors and say, if my client had a better housing situation, they would be much better off in their mental health. It is one of the most frustrating things we experience as mental health and addiction staff.\u201d",
  "In 2017, the GN introduced a five-year action plan for suicide prevention, which Madsen said led to \u201can increased acceptance that suicide prevention should be on everybody\u2019s agenda,\u201d but also highlighted shortcomings for the government to address.",
  "The next action plan will focus on helping communities in Nunavut establish professional mental health resources and offer better, more \u201crealistic\u201d suicide prevention training programs to RCMP officers.",
  "There also needs to be more community groups targeting men under 40 to help with suicide prevention, Madsen testified.",
  "\u201cRight now, we look at the number of programs being offered and we notice a lot of sewing and cooking. We don\u2019t see a lot of programs for men.\u201d",
  "She said men\u2019s groups can help participants get the tools and knowledge to \u201cpull themselves out of that moment.\u201d",
  "The four-day inquest is expected to conclude Thursday with the jury\u2019s verdict and recommendations."
