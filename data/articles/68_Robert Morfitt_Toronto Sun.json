  "On June 7, 2018, Raveendran and partner Const. Jason Crocker were responding to a \u201cperson with a gun\u201d call outside a Scarborough bar \u2014 a white male in a hoodie had shown patrons he was packing a black semi-automatic in his right pocket. \u201cAdvised to use caution,\u201d the dispatcher said.",
  "The 911 call had come in at midnight from Kevin Marshall, an off-duty officer who happened to be at the Muckish Irish Pub that night near Warden and St. Clair Aves. There\u2019d been an altercation and before leaving the pub, the man had flashed a gun and warned, \u201cLet\u2019s take it outside.\u201d",
  "\u201cHe\u2019s just left in a car,\u201d Marshall told the 911 operator.",
  "Raveendran activated his lights and sirens as they raced to the scene, but he was expecting the gunman to be long gone, or GOA, \u201cgone on arrival.\u201d They don\u2019t usually stick around after the police are called, he explained.",

  "They pulled into the parking lot and Raveendran was walking toward two civilians standing outside the back door of the bar when Marshall pointed out the suspect in a white Mercedes: \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d",
  "Everything changed, Raveendran said. It was \u201cgame on.\u201d",
  "He headed over to the car, saw the driver matched the suspect description, and that he was trying to reach for something in the console.",
  "\u201cWhat is this all about?\u201d the driver asked Crocker.",
  "\u201cGet out of the car,\u201d the police shouted in return. \u201cShow us your hands.\u201d",
  "They didn\u2019t know they were about to have a shoot-out with Robert Morfitt, a 36-year-old drug dealer who had just finished a nine-year prison term in October 2017 for multiple gun offences and was under a weapons ban. Seven years earlier, his statutory release for previous gun crimes was revoked after he was arrested pointing his firearm at police.",
  "Morfitt dropped his gun on command in 2011. But not this time.",
  "Raveendran said he decided the man posed enough of an immediate threat that he pulled his Glock out of its holster and opened the driver\u2019s door with his other hand.",
  "And then he looked into the barrel of a gun.",
  "\u201cIn seeing the firearm pointed at me, I can\u2019t remember who shot first. It was instantaneous, the exchange of gunfire,\u201d he told the mandatory inquest into Morfitt\u2019s death on Tuesday.",
  "Miraculously, one of the four shots from Morfitt\u2019s pistol hit the cellphone in the pocket of Raveendran\u2019s Kevlar vest, shattering the screen and bruising his heart. A few inches higher and he would have been dead.",
  "\u201cIt felt like a torpedo had hit me,\u201d the officer recalled, growing emotional as he watched the footage of the shootout played for the jury. \u201cI was in shock. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d been hit.\u201d",
  "He immediately heard more gunfire. His colleagues were coming to his aid.",
  "\u201cI see PC Raveendran grabbing his chest,\u201d Crocker testified. \u201cI take aim with my rifle and discharge my rifle.\u201d",
  "Hit by a hail of 15 police bullets, Morfitt was later pronounced dead at Sunnybrook hospital. Following an investigation, the SIU cleared all officers of any wrongdoing.",
  "\u201cNothing would have prepared me for that,\u201d Raveendran insisted. \u201cThere was nothing that could have helped it go the other way.\u201d",
  "In Morfatt\u2019s Mercedes, police found two fully-loaded Glock 9mm magazines in a bag, another large capacity 9mm magazine capable of dispensing 50 rounds of ammunition on the floor of the driver\u2019s seat and a \u201clarge amount of cash\u201d and drugs.",
  "Raveendran was asked why he chose to open the suspect\u2019s car door, putting himself in the line of fire, rather than taking cover. A representative from the Morfitt family wanted to know why there was no effort at de-escalation and why it was all over within 23 seconds.",
  "It was a dynamic situation, the officer explained, where he felt public safety was at risk from a gunman who wasn\u2019t obeying commands to step out or show his hands. There were bystanders in the parking lot, officers exposed, and it looked like the man was trying to access his weapon.",
  "He would later bear a wound to his heart to confirm he was right.",
  "\u201cI did the best job I could under the circumstances,\u201d maintained Raveendran, now with the guns and gangs task force. \u201cIf I had more time, I would have taken additional steps.\u201d",
  "The inquest continues.",
