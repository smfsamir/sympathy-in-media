  "While police vehicles were being positioned to box in the stolen vehicle, the man came out of the business, got back in the truck and rammed two police cars, ASIRT said.",
  "\u201cDuring their attempts to contain the man and the vehicle, two officers fired their service weapons,\u201d said ASIRT, a civilian oversight body that investigates incidents involving police that have resulted in serious injury or death.",
  "Court records show Weinmeyer had a long criminal history.",
  "He was released Nov. 8 on $200 cash bail with conditions, including not to be in a motor vehicle without the registered owner, stemming from two charges of possession of stolen motor vehicles.",

  "When Weinmeyer was arrested in 2009 in connection with a stolen vehicle, police called him a \u201cprolific car thief\u201d with a driving pattern that was \u201ca risk to the public.\u201d",
  "\u201cHe will flee from police and he has been known to carry weapons, so given his experience with us he was considered high risk,\u201d a police inspector told Postmedia at the time.",
  "But Weinmeyer\u2019s father, William, said his son\u2019s criminal history was the direct result of cognitive issues and addiction to narcotics.",
  "\u201cTerry had mental issues and drug issues, but that doesn\u2019t mean he deserved to die,\u201d Weinmeyer said. \u201cEveryone makes him out to be some sort of gangster, but if they knew him, he wasn\u2019t like that. He didn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d",

  "Police gave few details of the shooting Tuesday night, saying that ASIRT had instructed them not to speak to details of the incident until witnesses had been interviewed.",
  "ASIRT executive director Susan Hughson said there was nothing out of the ordinary in her agency instructing police not to release information.",
  "\u201cIt\u2019s not anything new,\u201d Hughson said, explaining police are always asked to stay mum while an investigation is ongoing.",
  "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing exceptional about this case as opposed to any other case with CPS,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to collect evidence as opposed to hearsay.\u201d",
  "Hughson said for ASIRT to release information at the onset of an investigation would be equally irresponsible.",
  "\u201cIt would look like we were prejudging a matter based on who we spoke to first,\u201d she said. \u201cASIRT\u2019s goal is that at the end of an investigation we will be able to tell the public what happened.\u201d",
  "\u201cThe (public\u2019s) need to know what happened has to be grounded in ensuring the integrity of the investigation.\u201d",
  "The incident was the ninth police-involved shooting this year."
