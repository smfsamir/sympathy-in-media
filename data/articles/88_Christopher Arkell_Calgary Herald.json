  "Christopher Arkell was shot at his property on March 22 after Chester Hunchak, a 67-year-old Medicine Hat businessman, went missing.",
  "Hunchak\u2019s Cadillac Escalade was seen at Arkell\u2019s property and when police arrived, he allegedly pointed a firearm at the officer, who retreated to his vehicle and called for backup.",
  "When police contacted Arkell by telephone, he threatened to shoot officers and other people, according to the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team, the group that investigates incidents involving police that result in death or injuries.",
  "Arkell was later seen dragging Hunchak\u2019s body behind his house before getting into his vehicle with a firearm and driving toward police, ASIRT said. An officer then fired a single fatal shot at Arkell.",
  "\u201cASIRT conducted a thorough, independent and objective investigation into the actions of the police officer,\u201d the investigative unit said in a release. \u201cExecutive director Mr. Clifton Purvis reviewed the completed investigative file and determined the officer\u2019s actions were justified.\u201d",
  "ASIRT said it was unable to release further information because RCMP and Medicine Hat police are still investigating the case, including the original report that Hunchak, who ran a second-hand vehicle dealership, was missing and may have been abducted.",
  "Before the shooting, Arkell was due in court on fraud and failing to appear charges."
