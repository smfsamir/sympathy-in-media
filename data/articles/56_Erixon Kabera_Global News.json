  "After being hit a number of times, the man was taken to an area hospital by paramedics and was pronounced dead shortly before 1 a.m. the following day.",
  "The SIU was then called in to investigate the matter.",
  "In the report, SIU director Joseph Martino said there were \u201cno reasonable grounds\u201d to lay charges against the officers in connection with the shooting, noting that they used \u201creasonable force.\u201d",
  "\u201cThe officers honestly believed they were looking at an actual gun in the Complainant\u2019s possession. Though mistaken, their misapprehension was a reasonable one. The object looked like a gun, the Complainant brandished it as a gun,\u201d Martino wrote.",
  "The man\u2019s family identified him as Kabera, a father of three, who they said dedicated his life to his family and community.",
  "There was some confusion surrounding the incident as the SIU initially reported that there was an exchange of gunfire but later announced it had found a replica firearm at the scene.",
  "One of the officers told SIU investigators he believed the man had been the first to open fire, but it appears he mistook the other officer\u2019s initial gunfire for shots coming from the man, Martino wrote, describing it as \u201can honest but mistaken belief in the highly charged atmosphere that prevailed.\u201d",
  "The SIU is an independent agency that investigates incidents involving police that have resulted in death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault."
