  "ASIRT clears RCMP, Edmonton police officers in deaths where controversial 'excited delirium syndrome' was a factor",
  "Alberta\u2019s law enforcement watchdog has cleared police in two separate incidents in which suspects went into \u201cmedical distress\u201d and died following rough arrests.",
  "On Friday, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team released its findings on two police-involved deaths: the 2018 death of Emroy Cardinal, and the 2019 death of an unidentified Edmonton man.",
  "Cardinal, 38, died after being repeatedly shocked with a Taser while RCMP attempted to arrest him at a St. Paul hotel. The Edmonton man, 43, was taken to the ground by police after setting a series of small fires. He told police he was \u201csuffocating\u201d minutes before officers noticed he had stopped breathing.",
  "Autopsies attributed the Edmonton man\u2019s death to \u201cstruggle with/restraint by police combined with methamphetamine use,\u201d while Cardinal\u2019s death was chalked up to \u201cexcited delirium syndrome as a result of cocaine toxicity.\u201d Both men had signs of underlying heart disease.",
  "Amanda Hart-Dowhun, a lawyer representing the Edmonton man\u2019s family, said both cases were examples where police involvement in a mental health crisis escalated the situation.",
  "\u201cWe have this situation where it started as essentially as a mental health call, and then within 10 minutes it escalated from a mental health call to a death,\u201d she said of the Edmonton case. \u201cThere has to be a better way.\u201d",
  "Cardinal, a member of the Whitefish Lake First Nation, began behaving strangely after checking into the Hampton Inn in St. Paul. Just before 2 a.m. on July 31, 2018, the desk clerk noticed him damaging cars and smashing windows in the parking lot. Cardinal told his wife \u201cthat people were there to shoot him.\u201d The woman later told the clerk that Cardinal did not have his medication and that he was \u201cacting schizophrenic.\u201d",
  "Cardinal eventually entered the lobby and continued to damage property. Two RCMP officers arrived and tried unsuccessfully to arrest him, after which he retreated to a storage room. He later grabbed a pair of scissors and, according to the officers, continued to resist, swinging at them and even pinning one of them to a wall. One of the officers was struck several times and was bleeding from her mouth, ASIRT said.",
  "Cardinal\u2019s wife told ASIRT she thought she could have talked him down, but police \u201cjust told her to go away.\u201d",
  "During the struggle, officers fired their Tasers four times, at least one of which hit Cardinal. He eventually dropped to the floor, where officers used kicks, punches and a \u201clateral neck restraint\u201d to subdue him.",
  "Officers later noticed Cardinal was in \u201cmedical distress\u201d and began CPR until an ambulance arrived. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the local hospital.",
  "In a report released Friday, ASIRT executive director Michael Ewenson concluded the officers involved in Cardinal\u2019s death followed the law and had done everything possible \u201cto resolve the situation without serious injury or death.\u201d",
  "\u201cUnfortunately, excited delirium syndrome as a result of cocaine toxicity was not something the subject officers could control.\u201d",
  "Edward and Emilene Blood, Cardinal\u2019s parents, questioned the excited delirium finding, made by Dr. Mitchell Weinberg of the Edmonton medical examiner\u2019s office. He said his family is \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the outcome and said the presence of police only escalated the situation.",
  "In 2021, the American Medical Association criticized the concept of excited delirium as a medical diagnosis, saying it \u201chas been misapplied and diagnosed disproportionately in law enforcement-related deaths of Black and Brown individuals.\u201d",
  "A nearby resident captured video of the arrest of the unidentified Edmonton man, who was seen burning paper near 114 Street and Jasper Avenue after dark on June 28, 2019.",
  "The first officer on scene said the man refused to stop when told he was under arrest for arson. The officer told ASIRT he worried the man might flee or assault him, so he grabbed him by the arm, attempted to lock it behind his back, then took him to the ground when he tried to pull away.",
  "Two of the officers speculated the man might have been experiencing \u201cexcited delirium.\u201d",
  "Summarizing the officer\u2019s interview, ASIRT said the man was \u201cunrelenting in his struggle on the ground,\u201d such that two officers were unable to get him in handcuffs. He later \u201cmade a sudden and explosive movement\u201d to escape the officers.",
  "Eventually, police were able to handcuff the man and use a \u201chobble\u201d strap to secure his feet. A spit mask was attached to his face. A few minutes after the resident started filming, the man can be heard to say \u201cI\u2019m suffocating,\u201d to which one of the subject officers replied \u201cno, you\u2019re not.\u201d Officers later transferred him to a police van but removed him when they noticed he stopped breathing. The man\u2019s head struck the pavement as officers carried him to perform CPR.",
  "In his report, Ewenson said the victim\u2019s \u201csuffocating\u201d comment was concerning, but noted the medical examiner\u2019s findings \u201cremove such concern.\u201d",
  "\u201cAs was previously noted, the cause of death was found to be struggle with/restraint by police combined with methamphetamine use,\u201d Ewenson wrote, adding the victim\u2019s enlarged heart and history of schizophrenia were contributing factors. \u201cImportantly, the medical examiner found the mechanism of death to be unstable electrical activity in the heart.\u201d"
