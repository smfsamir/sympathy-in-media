  "The IIO sent investigators to gather evidence and interview witnesses. But the process got delayed because of a difference of opinion between the IIO and VPD. The IIO took Vancouver police Chief Adam Palmer and seven of his officers to court over what it considered a lack of cooperation with an investigation into the fatal shooting. The court favoured the IIO and the investigation was completed in December.",
  "In its report, the IIO details how the incident unfolded from the time Rintoul, described as a large man who weighed over 430 pounds, entered the store on Nov. 10, 2016 around 3 p.m.",
  "He went to the hunting desk, bear-sprayed an employee and then stabbed him. He then broke open a gun case and tried to load a long gun but left with just the bear mace and knife.",
  "Rintoul then grabbed another man at knifepoint and tried to leave the store but was immediately grabbed by two police officers outside. Rintoul tried to spray mace at the officers and then stabbed one of them. More officers arrived.",
  "Police were unable to restrain Rintoul with a Taser or the first few gunshots. He kept trying to use the mace on officers until he was fully down and motionless. He was shot nine times and Tasered four times.",
  "A police officer quoted by the IIO in the report said, \u201cI fully believe he would have been stabbing us, unless if we acted.\u201d",
  "Another officer said if Rintoul \u201ccontinued to get up in the fashion he was getting up then in my mind the only other way to stop that threat would be to use lethal force.\u201d",
  "The IIO concluded that Rintoul \u201cposed a threat of deadly force to the members of the public\u201d and that the officers acted as required. \u201cThe evidence collected does not provide grounds to consider any charges against any officer.\u201d",
