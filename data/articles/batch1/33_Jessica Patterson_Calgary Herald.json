  "Family of woman shot and killed by police say she deserved better",
  "Family of a 27-year-old woman killed by police on a quiet residential street in Sunalta last November say they\u2019re struggling to understand what happened in the moments before her death.",
  "Jessica Lynn Patterson was shot by police on Nov. 29, the fifth fatal incident in a record year for shootings by the Calgary Police Service.",
  "She has not been previously identified by the CPS or the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT), who are currently investigating.",
  "Now, her family members have come forward to flesh out the picture painted by authorities in the immediate aftermath of her death.",
  "\u201cI just want everybody to know, she was not a bad person,\u201d said Jessica\u2019s mom, Trena Patterson.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m just devastated. I want to know the truth. I won\u2019t rest until I do know the truth. That\u2019s what I want \u2014 justice for Jessica. I don\u2019t want anything else from anybody. If she was shot for no good reason, I want somebody punished for it.\u201d",
  "According to details provided by police and ASIRT at the time of the shooting, officers were called to Patterson\u2019s condo on 11th Avenue S.W. around 2:30 a.m. for a check on welfare for a woman who was screaming and acting erratically, banging on car windows and doors outside.",
  "Officers arriving on scene were confronted by a woman carrying a knife in each hand, ASIRT said. Photos shared by ASIRT show one long, metal implement with a broken handle, and one shorter kitchen-type knife.",
  "\u201cEvents escalated and a one-year member of the CPS discharged her service firearm; (the) woman was struck and subsequently died as a result,\u201d CPS said in a release the next day.",
  "\u201cThe members involved in this incident have the full support of the Executive and the Calgary Police Association.\u201d",
  "Trena says it\u2019s hard to recognize her daughter in the descriptions of what happened that night from police. Jessica had spoken to her just hours earlier, texting \u201cI love you\u201d and \u201ctalk to you in the morning.\u201d",
  "She\u2019d been living at the condo in the inner-city neighbourhood of Sunalta with her cat and a Pomeranian named Thor while separated from her husband. She spent a lot of time working out at the Crossfit gym next door, visiting with her mom and doting on her two pets.",
  "\u201cShe had big plans for herself. She was planning to return to school for upgrading at Bow Valley College,\u201d Trena said.",
  "Trena says she knows Jessica had previously done drugs and acknowledges she was taking methadone \u2014 used in addiction detox and maintenance programs \u2014 but didn\u2019t believe she was currently abusing drugs.",
  "Though it was reported in November that she was known to police, a search of court records showed Jessica had no criminal record.",
  "\u201cJessica was no crazy person. She was very smart. She wasn\u2019t a druggie . . . She was doing well. She was doing the best she\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
  "In the early morning hours of Nov. 29, the streets of Sunalta were mostly deserted, with only the occasional passing car.",
  "One person who was awake, a neighbour in Jessica\u2019s building who called 911, says she didn\u2019t even recognize the woman in the street yelling and \u201cgrunting\u201d as she weaved erratically around on the street below.",
  "\u201cI didn\u2019t notice she was carrying knives until she stopped and I noticed something shiny,\u201d said the woman, who asked not to be identified.",
  "It was then she decided to call police, worried both for the woman and any pedestrians who might cross her path.",
  "Only a couple of cars passed by, slowing briefly before speeding away. It felt like a long time before police came. What happened next was hard to process.",
  "\u201cMaybe five minutes later (the police) came. They turned toward the south and they stopped. And then I see the lady with the knives run to the building (across the street) and then she turned back, she kind of yelled or grunted or something and then I heard the two shots.",
  "\u201cI thought I was watching a movie. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was real or not. I was shocked when they shot her. I didn\u2019t believe it at first.\u201d",
  "She couldn\u2019t see the woman or the police clearly. It was dark and bushes obscured part of her view. But she waited at the window watching as paramedics arrived and began working on the woman in the street.",
  "\u201cI was shocked that they shot her. I thought they would do something besides shooting her,\u201d she said. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe that it happened.\u201d",
  "CPS declined to comment on the incident since the matter has now been handed over to ASIRT, which investigates incidents involving police that result in serious injury or death.",
  "Last November at a news conference, Calgary police Chief Roger Chaffin said the officers involved in the shooting had his \u201cfull and complete support.\u201d",
  "\u201cFrom the information I have been given, I am firmly of the belief that this member acted appropriately to protect herself, her partner and members of the public,\u201d Chaffin said.",
  "Chaffin also said at the time he believed a significant factor behind a lot of the crime in Calgary currently is related to the abuse of opioids and methamphetamine. He did not specify whether drugs were connected to the shooting on Nov. 29.",
  "\u201cHeavy, heavy addiction, without the right treatments that forces people into crime to support that drug, can be a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we get on top of that problem, our officers are being forced into more and more chaotic situations.\u201d",
  "Trena says that even if her daughter was on drugs that night, things should have turned out differently.",
  "\u201cIt didn\u2019t give them any reason to do what they did. Being on the downtown beat, they should be trained to deal with people and whatever kind of sickness they have.\u201d",
  "She says waiting for ASIRT\u2019s investigation to conclude so she can get some answers has been difficult. She knows a few things for sure: she knows Jessica was shot twice in the chest by a rookie police officer within seconds of arriving on the scene. She knows Jessica was dead by the time they arrived at the hospital.",
  "She also knows police video of the incident exists, but she\u2019s already decided it would be too difficult to watch.",
  "\u201cI\u2019m still in shock. When I sit down and think about things, I hyperventilate and I have to catch my breath. I don\u2019t sleep much.",
  "\u201cJessica did not deserve that. She didn\u2019t deserve that at all.\u201d"
