  "A family member of a 17-year-old boy who was shot and killed by police on Norway House Cree Nation Friday is calling the death a senseless act of violence and questioning how the shooting can be justified.",
  "Brian Rowden identified the victim as his cousin, Elgyn Muskego, who he described as gentle, soft-spoken and small at around five feet tall.",
  "\u201cI know who the kid was and I know that he couldn\u2019t be that big of a threat, even with a knife in his hand,\u201d Rowden told the Free Press Saturday.",
  "In a news release Friday, RCMP said officers were called around 1:45 a.m. to a house in Norway House, also known as Kinosew Sipi Cree Nation, located 450 kilometres north of Winnipeg.",
  "Manitoba\u2019s police watchdog, the Independent Investigation Unit, which has taken over the investigation, said a resident of the home reported a male was high, agitated and armed.",
  "When officers arrived, they found the youth outside armed with an edged weapon, RCMP said.",
  "He refused \u201cnumerous orders to drop the weapon\u201d and advanced towards officers, Mounties said. An RCMP officer then shot him.",
  "But Rowden questioned why police couldn\u2019t find another way to de-escalate the situation.",
  "\u201cIs that not what combat training is for? Isn\u2019t that what Tasers are for? Isn\u2019t that what all these other methods of apprehension are for, before they utilize their gun?\u201d Rowden said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t. They just went straight for their gun.\u201d",
  "The death has sent shock waves through the northern Manitoba community already struggling with grief, Rowden said.",
  "A 23-year-old woman was found dead in her Norway House home on Nov. 14. Derek Bruce Forbister, 35, also a Norway House resident, has been charged with manslaughter.",
  "Rowden, who said Elgyn was struggling with his mental health, called on RCMP officers stationed in the community to do more to understand the issues people in the community are facing.",
  "\u201cIf cops even knew a little bit of that, maybe they might have had some sort of compassion, but they don\u2019t even try to know anything, the details like that, about our people,\u201d he said.",
  "Elgyn Muskego, 17, was shot and killed by police on Norway House Cree Nation Friday.",
  "Rowden said there have been other deaths related to violence in Norway House in the last few weeks, which he called a close-knit First Nation, a community of 8,000-plus members.",
  "\u201cYou can feel it in the community right now, everyone\u2019s hurting, everyone\u2019s in pain, everyone\u2019s angry.\u201d",
  "A weekly look at politics close to home and around the world.",
